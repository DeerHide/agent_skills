# Python Testing

## When to use this skill?

- Use this skill when writing unit tests for Python applications.
- Use this skill when writing integration tests with mocked infrastructure.
- Use this skill when writing integration tests with real resources using testcontainers.
- Use this skill when setting up pytest configuration and fixtures.
- Use this skill when running tests in parallel with pytest-xdist.
- Use this skill when following test-driven development (TDD) practices.
- Use this skill when testing FastAPI applications and use cases.

---

## Overview

This skill provides testing patterns for Python applications following a layered testing strategy:

| Test Type | Purpose | Dependencies |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Test isolated units of code (functions, classes, methods) | Mocked dependencies |
| **Integration Tests (Mocked)** | Test interaction between components | Mocked infrastructure (databases, APIs) |
| **Integration Tests (Real)** | Validate infrastructure integration | Real resources via testcontainers |

The testing approach follows Clean Architecture principles, using dependency injection to enable easy mocking and isolation of components.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Test individual components in isolation. All external dependencies are mocked.

- Located in `tests/units/`
- Fast execution, no I/O operations
- Test business logic in domain and application layers
- Mock all repositories, services, and external clients

For detailed patterns, see [Unit Testing](references/unit-testing.md).

### Integration Tests with Mocks

Test interaction between multiple components with mocked infrastructure.

- Located in `tests/integrations/`
- Test API routes with mocked use cases
- Test use cases with mocked repositories
- Validate request/response serialization

For detailed patterns, see [Integration Testing with Mocks](references/integration-testing-mocks.md).

### Integration Tests with Real Resources

Validate infrastructure integration using testcontainers.

- Located in `tests/integrations/`
- Use real databases, message queues, etc.
- Validate repository implementations
- Test database migrations and queries

For detailed patterns, see [Integration Testing with Testcontainers](references/integration-testing-testcontainers.md).

### Fixtures

Use shared fixtures for test data and setup/teardown logic.
For detailed patterns, see [Test Fixtures](references/test-fixtures.md).

## Test Structure

```
tests/
|-- __init__.py
|-- conftest.py              # Shared fixtures
|-- fixtures/                # Test data factories
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- book_fixtures.py
|-- units/                   # Unit tests
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- domain/
|   |-- usecases/
|   |-- services/
|-- integrations/            # Integration tests
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- api/
|   |-- persistence/
```
